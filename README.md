# Assignments

This is the repository where each student will find their assignments for class.

Each assignment is in a folder numbered for the assignment. In that directory will be a README that details the assigment. There may also be some additional assets needed for the assignment, these may be found in folders such as *images*, *assets*, etc. within each assignment folder. However, there may sometimes be an additional folder titled *_meta*. You can generally ignore this folder, that is where I will put assets needed for the README (like example images.)
